(* The small-step conversion relation.

The calculus of constructions and related theories have a notion of type equivalence: if
two well-sorted types are "convertible" then the terms of one are the terms of the other.
Two terms (such as these types) are convertible if they are equal after applying some
sequence of reduction rules, such as those of beta reduction.

This is "small-step" since it has not yet been extended into an equivalence relation.

Inductive step : relation :=

(* Terms are convertible if one beta reduces to the other. *)
| beta : forall (t u : preterm), Beta.beta t u -> step t u.

Hint Constructors step : way.

Definition conversion := equivalence step.

Hint Unfold conversion : way.

Example conversion_relates_terms_with_common_beta_reducts :
  conversion
    (prod
      (app (abs (type 1) (bvar 0)) (type 0))
      (type 0))
    (prod
      (type 0)
      (app (abs (type 1) (bvar 0)) (type 0))).
Proof.
  apply (Equivalence.transitivity Conversion.step (prod (type 0) (type 0)));
  [ | apply Equivalence.symmetry ];
  infer.
