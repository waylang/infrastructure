(* Typings are proofs that under a given context, a given term has the given type.

Since types are terms, this emerges as a ternary relation between a context and two terms.

An interesting twist appears in the definition of contexts.  A context is a list that that
identifies the types of free variables in a term.  Since types are terms, the types
appearing in the context must themselves be well-typed, and can have free variables.  This
circular dependency is accounted for with a pair of mutually recursive definitions (or
"judgements").

The first kind of judgement is the typing of terms.

(* The type of a sort is the next sort in the hierarchy. *)
| type :

  forall (c : context), well_formed c -> forall (a : atom) (T : preterm), has (a, T) c ->
  typing c (Preterm.free_variable a) T

(* The type of a product is a sort, shared with its domain and codomain after opening.

Since the codomain can depend on the domain, we only require it to type after opening it
with the domain (using a sufficiently fresh free variable.)
*)

  typing c (Preterm.product T U) (Preterm.type n)

(* The type of an abstraction is a well-typed product.

The abstraction body must have the product codomain as its type, after each has been
opened with the product's domain type (using a sufficiently fresh free variable.)

  typing c (Preterm.abstraction T t) (Preterm.product T U)

(* The type of an application is its abstraction's codomain type opened with the argument.

The abstraction must have a product as its type, and the argument must be well-typed.
The equation involving open is required to allow proof search to match the head.
