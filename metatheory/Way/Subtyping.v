(* The subtyping relation.

Subtyping serves two roles in this logic.  First it includes conversion, and so the
conversion typing rule becomes the subtyping rule.  Second it brings transitivity to the
type hierarchy, allowing (type 0) to be considered a term of (type 2), for example.
*)
Inductive subtyping : relation :=

(* Convertible types are subtypes of each other. *)
| conversion : forall (T U : preterm), Conversion.conversion T U -> subtyping T U

(* Each sort is a subtype of the next in the hierarchy. *)
| type : forall (n : nat), subtyping (Preterm.type n) (Preterm.type (S n))

(* Subtyping descends into codomains of products with convertible domains. *)
| product : forall (l : list atom) (T V : preterm), Conversion.conversion T V ->
  forall (U W : preterm), (fresh (a : l), subtyping (open_free a U) (open_free a W)) ->
  subtyping (Preterm.product T U) (Preterm.product V W)

(* Terms are reflexivily subtypes of themselves. *)
(* TODO(phs): If we could move this guard then we could use star. *)
(* TODO(phs): Alternately, we could demand relations deal only in terms *)
| reflexivity : forall (T : preterm), term T -> subtyping T T

(* Subtyping is transitive. *)
| transitivity :
    forall (U T V : preterm), subtyping T U -> subtyping U V -> subtyping T V.
