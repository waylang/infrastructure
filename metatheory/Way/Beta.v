(* Small-step beta reduction.

Beta reduction eliminates application-abstraction pairs, called beta redexes.  Beta
reduction is "full": to find redexes beta reduction looks within type annotations and
abstraction bodies, as well as applications.  In other words, beta redexes appearing in
either side of applications, abstractions and products may be reduced.

The possibility of computation within abstractions creates non-determinism, but see the
Church-Rosser property. It shows that no race conditions are present: all evaluation paths
eventually lead to the same term.

(* Applications of abstractions beta reduce to opening the body with the argument.

The function must be a locally closed abstraction and the argument must be locally closed.
The equation involving open is required to allow proof search to match the head.
